<h3 id="are-you-a-complete-beginner">Are you a complete beginner?</h3>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have any idea what these methods are all about but you &rsquo;re curious to try, just start with the &ldquo;mindfulness of breath&rdquo; instructions.</p>
<p>In addition to the instructions given in this guide, I suggest that you don&rsquo;t only focus on the breath but you also do breath counting (from 1 to 10 and back), as <a href="https://github.com/atrahhdis/shargrol">Shargrol</a> suggests on the <a href="https://shargrolpostscompilation.blogspot.com/p/blog-page.html#awarenessandcountingofbreath">following text</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Awareness and counting of breath is a great practice. For what it&rsquo;s worth, a good, practical combination is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Awareness of breathing as the meditation object</li>
<li>Counting of breath as the meditation method</li>
<li>When the count is realized to be lost, &ldquo;note&rdquo; what is currently in the mind. What did you wake up to?  Sensations, emotions, or thoughts in mind? Note what is currently in mind. e.g. &ldquo;planning thought&rdquo;, &ldquo;discomfort&rdquo;, &ldquo;frustration&rdquo;, &ldquo;pleasure&rdquo;, etc.</li>
<li>Give yourself a mini congratulations that you woke up from distraction. Yea!!</li>
<li>Find the breathing sensations again</li>
<li>Count the breath again</li>
</ol>
<p>The whole point of this method is to learn (over time!) how to gently center the mind around awareness of the breath and to sensitize the mind to &ldquo;waking up&rdquo; from distraction. Of course the mind has a mind of its own, so to speak, so you don&rsquo;t force this to happen. You&rsquo;re more like a parent watching a toddler learn to walk. The mind &ldquo;learns to walk&rdquo; on its own. And if you rush it or get angry or frustrated, you&rsquo;re just freaking out the baby!  Although this sounds like a simple practice, it puts you directly in touch with mindfulness and it greatly increases awareness &ndash; don&rsquo;t underestimate it!</p>

<h3 id="are-you-interested-in-noting">Are you interested in noting?</h3>
<p>If you have decided to go with noting (which is <a href="https://mahasivipassana.com">Mahasi Sayadaw&rsquo;s Vipassana</a> technique), apart from this nice introductory text included in the above pack, I suggest you to read the following material:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://mahasivipassana.com/docs/practical-vipassana-meditation-exercises/">Practical Vipassana Meditation Exercises</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://mahasivipassana.com/docs/practical-insight-meditation-basic-practice/">Practical Insight Meditation: Basic Practice</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I also suggest you to have a look at this contemporary version of noting by <a href="https://kennethfolkdharma.com">Kenneth Folk</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://mahasivipassana.com/contemporary-noting/#kenneth-folks-detailed-freestyle-noting">Kenneth Folk&rsquo;s Freestyle Noting</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind that you can actually practise by &ldquo;labeling out loud&rdquo;, as Folk does in these videos. Sometimes, it really helps!</p>
