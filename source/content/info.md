# Info

## Who Am I?

I'm a secular Buddhist and an [amateur photographer](https://vlzetko.com).

I used to be a pragmatic [Mahasi noting](https://mahasivipassana.com) geek, obsessed with the [Progress of Insight map](https://mahasivipassana.com/the-progress-of-insight-map/). 

My current practice is heavily influenced by [Asin Tejaniya](https://ashintejaniya.org/), various secular non-dual teachers ([Diana Winston](https://dianawinston.com), [Loch Kelly](https://lochkelly.org), [Richard Lang](https://www.headless.org/contact/richard-lang.htm), etc.) and [Soto Zen](https://www.sotozen.com/eng).
