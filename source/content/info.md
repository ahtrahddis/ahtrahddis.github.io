## Who Am I?

It really doesn't matter at all who I am, but let me give you some context.

I'm a secular Buddhist and an [amateur photographer](https://vlzetko.com).

I used to be a pragmatic [Mahasi noting](https://mahasivipassana.com) geek, obsessed with the [Progress of Insight map](https://mahasivipassana.com/the-progress-of-insight-map/), until I decided to stop chasing my tail.

My current practice is heavily influenced by:
 
- [Sayadaw U Tejaniya](https://ashintejaniya.org/)

- [Soto Zen](https://www.sotozen.com/eng) (mainly [Kōdō Sawaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%8Dd%C5%8D_Sawaki) and [Gudo Wafu Nishijima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gud%C5%8D_Wafu_Nishijima) lineages)

- Chan ([Sheng Yen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheng-yen) lineage)

- various secular non-dual teachers ([Loch Kelly](https://lochkelly.org), [Stephan Bodian](https://www.stephanbodian.org/), [Diana Winston](https://dianawinston.com), [Richard Lang](https://www.headless.org/contact/richard-lang.htm), etc.)


Recently, I gained interest in [Early Buddhist Texts](https://suttacentral.net/), not as a means to follow the "real path" or whatever. I just lost interest in "Buddhist psychology" books and became curious to learn from the most accurate source, what probably Siddhartha Gautama taught.
