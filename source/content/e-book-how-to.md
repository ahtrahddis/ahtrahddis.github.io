## E-book Creation
 
 For the creation of all these e-books, the following procedure is followed:

- the text is pasted & formatted with / written in / converted to [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) (the conversion is done using various methods) - in rare cases other formats, ie. html, are used

- the markdown (**.md**) file is converted to **epub** using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)

- the **epub** file is edited with [calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) and finally...

- the **epub** file is converted to **mobi** and **azw3** (in **azw3** additional soft hyphenation is applied using [hyphenate this!](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=208534) module)

For some texts, **pdf** files are provided too. These ones have either been created:

- with the "quick 'n dirty" method of conversion via calibre, which is a bad solution as there is very little formatting control

- by exporting the epub to **docx/odt**, applying further editing, formatting and finally exporting to **pdf**.

The latter ([example 1](https://github.com/atrahhdis/alohadharma/raw/master/ebooks/Aloha%20Dharma:%20a%20compilation%20of%20texts%20from%20alohadharma.com.pdf), [example 2](https://github.com/atrahhdis/medinra/raw/master/ebooks/Meditation%2C%20insight%2C%20and%20rationality%20-%20DavidM.pdf)) is the method I prefer and I will try to provide similar pdfs for most of the texts.
